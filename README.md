# RNaseViz-RNase-Sequence-Visualization-Tool

RNaseViz is a web-based application built with R Shiny, providing an interactive platform for visualizing RNase sequences, their conservation across different species, and the mutations associated with Mendelian diseases.

## Features

- Selection of RNase enzymes from a predefined list.
- Visualization of sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments.
- Interactive phylogenetic trees illustrating evolutionary relationships.
- Highlighting specific mutations and their positions within the sequences.
- Support for various RNase enzymes with associated Mendelian disease mutations.

## Usage

To use the RNaseViz application:

1. **Select RNase**: From the dropdown menu labeled "Choose RNase:", select the RNase enzyme you wish to analyze.
2. **Visualize**: Click the 'Visualize' button to load the sequence data and related visualizations.
3. **Highlight Mutation**: Use the "Select organism:" dropdown to choose the organism of interest, enter a position number in the reference sequence, and click 'Highlight position' to view specific mutations.
4. **Explore Tree**: The displayed tree structure allows you to explore how different RNase sequences relate to different species.
5. **Inspect Mutations**: The sequence visualization will show highlighted regions corresponding to entered mutations.
6. **Download Global Alignment**: Download sequence alignments in FASTA or PDF formats for offline analysis.

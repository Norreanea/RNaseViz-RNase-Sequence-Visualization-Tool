# RNaseViz-RNase-Sequence-Visualization-Tool

RNaseViz is a web-based application built with R Shiny, providing an interactive platform for visualizing RNase sequences, their conservation across different species, and the mutations associated with Mendelian diseases.

## Features

- Selection of RNase enzymes from a predefined list.
- Visualization of sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments.
- Interactive phylogenetic trees illustrating evolutionary relationships.
- Highlighting specific mutations and their positions within the sequences.
- Support for various RNase enzymes with associated Mendelian disease mutations.

## Usage

To use the RNaseViz application:

1. **Select RNase**: Choose an RNase enzyme from the dropdown menu to begin the analysis.
2. **Visualize**: Click the 'Visualize' button to load the sequence data and related visualizations.
3. **Highlight Mutation**: Enter a position number in the human reference sequence and click 'Highlight position' to view specific mutations.
4. **Explore Tree**: Click on different parts of the phylogenetic tree to see detailed evolutionary relationships.
5. **Inspect Mutations**: The sequence visualization will show highlighted regions corresponding to entered mutations.

# RNaseViz-RNase-Sequence-Visualization-Tool
RNaseViz is an R Shiny app visualizing RNase sequences, conservation, and mutations linked to Mendelian diseases. It supports interactive analysis and highlights critical mutation impacts across species.
RNaseViz: RNase Sequence Visualization Tool
RNaseViz is a web-based application built with R Shiny, providing an interactive platform for visualizing RNase sequences, their conservation across different species, and the mutations associated with Mendelian diseases.

Features
Selection of RNase enzymes from a predefined list.
Visualization of sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments.
Interactive phylogenetic trees illustrating evolutionary relationships.
Highlighting specific mutations and their positions within the sequences.
Support for various RNase enzymes with associated Mendelian disease mutations.
Usage
To use the RNaseViz application:

Select RNase: Choose an RNase enzyme from the dropdown menu to begin the analysis.
Visualize: Click the 'Visualize' button to load the sequence data and related visualizations.
Highlight Mutation: Enter a position number in the human reference sequence and click 'Highlight position' to view specific mutations.
Explore Tree: Click on different parts of the phylogenetic tree to see detailed evolutionary relationships.
Inspect Mutations: The sequence visualization will show highlighted regions corresponding to entered mutations.
